# Introduction
I am Aashutosh Aman Mishra, a Ph.D. candidate in Aerospace Engineering at Auburn University, graduating in May 2025. 

My expertise includes aircraft design, aero-propulsive model development, flight dynamics, flight control system development, and real-time flight simulation, with a focus on novel/unconventional advanced air mobility concepts. 

My research goal is to develop a **_unified sizing and flight simulation framework_** to ensure that the vehicle is sized to exhibit desirable flying qualities during flight.

- Developed generalized tools for rapid vehicle design, aircraft sizing, and real-time flight simulation for conventional as well as novel advanced air mobility configurations, including fuel-burning, all-electric, and hybrid-electric aircraft.
   
- Integrated mass-properties evaluation within the sizing framework where the vehicle is not considered as a point-mass during design mission evaluation.

- Implemented a strip-theory based modeling approach to tackle coupled aero-propulsive interactions and validated them with CFD-generated and wind tunnel results.  

- Formulated a module for airfoil design optimization based on surface parameterization using Class-Shape Transformation (CST) parameters and shape optimization.

- Multi-disciplinary analysis & optimization (MDO/MDAO) of UAM flight vehicle using genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) in MATLAB.  

- Developed propeller/rotor design and analysis framework to evaluate the propeller performance at design and off-design flight conditions.  

- Integrated aircraft longitudinal and lateral-directional flight dynamic characteristics, based on a fully nonlinear 6-DOF flight simulation model to meet the handling qualities guidelines defined by 14 CFR Part 23 and Part 25 for fixed-wing aircraft and ADS-33E-PRF for rotary-wing aircraft during vehicle sizing.

- Led the development, integration, and validation of aero-propulsive characteristics for novel eVTOL designs into the research flight simulators driven by a MATLAB/Simulink-based non-linear time domain simulation framework.

- Gained hands-on experience with flight simulator construction, flight control system development, cockpit displays and control setup, visualization setup, and model calibration, to facilitate flight simulator operation.

- Integrated in-house fight dynamic models (developed in MATLAB) and aircraft configuration files into the environment of FlightGear and X-Plane for visual references in the flight simulator.

- Tutored aircraft design tools like OpenVSP, XFOIL, QMIL/QPROP, and CFD (FlightStream®) to the aircraft design class.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceffaa5f-59d5-49ad-a938-212120c81148)

  My goal is to connect the aircraft design and flight dynamics together to achieve a flight vehicle that exhibits desirable "flying qualities" during piloted/automated flight.
